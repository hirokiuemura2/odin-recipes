    <h2>Directions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Stir in orzo and return to a boil. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Cook pasta uncovered until partially cooked through but not yet soft, about 5 minutes; 
            drain and rinse with cold water until cooled completely.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add carrots, celery, and onion; 
            cook and stir until vegetables begin to soften and onion becomes translucent, 5 to 7 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add garlic; cook and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute more. Season mixture with thyme, 
            oregano, bay leaf, salt, and black pepper; continue cooking another 30 seconds before 
            pouring chicken broth into the pot.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bring broth to a boil. Partially cover the pot, reduce heat to medium-low, and 
            simmer until vegetables are just tender, about 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir orzo, lemon juice, and lemon zest into broth; add chicken. Cook until chicken 
            and orzo are heated through, about 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add baby spinach; cook until spinach wilts into broth and orzo is tender, 2 to 3 minutes. 
            Ladle soup into bowls; garnish with lemon slices and Parmesan cheese.
        </li>
    </ol>
